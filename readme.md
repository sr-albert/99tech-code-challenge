# Before you start

Dear interviewer,

I have been supported by Claude Code in the **Problem 2**

It lives on: https://albert-99tech.netlify.app/

## Why I use AI in the code challenge?

In the AI era, we can use AI to move faster, but we must have solid knowledge to control it and not rely on it.

Using AI does not mean I am cheating; it means I am adapting and utilizing modern solutions to achieve my goals. Just as people began using the internet to send emails instead of writing handwritten letters, I embrace new technologies to enhance my work.

I built my solution first, ensured it worked as expected, and then enhanced it by applying AI with prompts.


⚠️ I put the notes on the top of parts fully generated by AI; they are just mock data.

## Styling

I defined important parts like `:root`, `*` and `body`, the rest part is generated by Claude code by using the prompt defined in `styling-rule.md`

## Module structure and routing

- Each problem lives under `src/problemX` as a self-contained module.
- To be viewable, a module should include an `index.html` entry file: `src/problemX/index.html`.
  - Vite detects multiple HTML entry points and builds them as separate pages.
  - After build, pages are available at `/problemX/` (or `/problemX/index.html`).
- The parent app `src/index.html` lists available modules and links to their pages.
- Dev:
  - `npm run dev` → visit `http://localhost:5173/` for the module list.
  - Direct links like `http://localhost:5173/problem2/` work as well.
- Build/Deploy:
  - `npm run build` outputs to `dist/` with one folder per module.
  - Netlify serves existing files directly; the catch-all redirect only applies when no file matches.
